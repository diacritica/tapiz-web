# Tapiz (Spanish for Tapestry)
Effect Engine setting specific incarnations or embroideries

This project seeks the building of a fantasy-setting agnostic RPG rulebook based on Effect Engine by Mindjammer Press that is easily adapted to a selection of fantasy settings or "embroideries".

The core rulebook, called Tapiz (Tapestry) is probably not enough to become a stand-alone RPG, at least one of the applied settings or embroideries is needed as they contain basic content such as classes, races, equipment, spells and a bestiary. If you are in doubt, Adventures in the East Mark is a good choice for a classic fantasy setting.

## Planned embroideries

### Scarred Lands
The setting is set on the world of Scarn in a post-apocalyptic era where the world is recovering from a horrific war between the Gods and Titans, which ended 150 years ago and left the land warped.

### Adventures in the East Mark
The setting is set on the world created by Pedro Gil and the rest of the Aventureros Errantes de la Marca del Este creative crew. Heavily inspired by the D&D settings with some Tolkien and Howard influence.

### Middle-earth
The setting is set on the world created by JRR Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit constitute the main references but The Silmarillion and The History of Middle-earth are helpful additions too.

## Basic source material

Whether we borrow content or not, these two huge supplements to Monsters & Magic are critical to Tapiz.

Collectanea Creaturae: a massive monsters manual for M&M. By Ebon Gryphon Games.
Aperita Arcana: a collection of new classes, races, equipment, magic items, spells and optional rules. By Ebon Gryphon Games.
