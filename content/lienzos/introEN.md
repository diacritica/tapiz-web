# Embroidery Structure

In order to enjoy consistency accross all embroideries, every one willing to be named as such needs to contain at least the following sections.

## Introduction to the setting

Where the GM and the player can learn what is the setting about, source books or creative works to learn more and the type of roleplaying that is suggested. Also, a brief summary of the rest of the contents presented in the document.

It will also contain the two capital letters linked to this embroidery, called **embroidery code** or **EC**.

## Classes

A list of playable character classes. A minimum of five is strongly recommended. These classes must be self-contained so that they only need to reference either the embroidery document or the Tapiz rulebook for any reader to understand how it works.

Explicit is better than implicit. For example. Instead of saying "The Ranger class is similar to both the Warrior class and the Explorer class with the only difference in the traits you can use (listed below) and the initial weapons of choice" you should flesh out the class entirely, even if the majority of the content is somewhat redundant.

## Races

Similarly to Classes, it will contain a list of playable character races. In fantasy settings, when we talk about *races* it's not unusual to actually mean *species* but we consider this common misinterpretation so we can include both *species* (ie *elves*) and races (ie *Haradrim*) under the title of *races*.

Again, explicit is better than implicit although some exception might apply to variations or subsets of a specific race that can inherit most of what the race entitles and simply mention what makes this *sub-race* relevant.

## Equipment

Tapix does not include an Equipment chapter because even if certain objects do exist in many different fantasy settings, their prices or currency might differ. It is the embroidery's duty to list basic and advances equipment for a setting.

## Spells

A complete grimoire for the different types of magic and spell levels allowed by the settings and related to races and classes.

Each spell needs to be properly addressed with little or no shortcuts. It is better to provide fewer but better explained spells than long lists of spells titles.

Every spell must have a code to uniquely identify it. This code is formed using the EC, then S and four digits (ie ECS0501).

## Monsters

A complete bestiary that would make sense in the setting of choice. It should include basic and common creatures as well as more powerful and sophisticated ones.

Each creature needs to be properly addressed with little or no shortcuts. It is better to provide fewer but better explained creatures than long lists of creatures names.

Every creature must have a code to uniquely identify it. This code is formed using the EC, then C and four digits (ie ECC0010).

## Optional rules

Tapiz, being a setting agnostic rulebook describes the more commom game mechanics. This should give room to each embroidery plenty of room to ellaborate on optional rules that either clarify or amplify core rules or make sense in the referred setting.

Every optional rule must have a code to uniquely identify it. This code is formed using the EC, then R and four digits (ie ECR1111).

## Conversion techniques

If the embroidery is heavily inspired by content created by others and it is of great value giving hints to easily convert existing material to being Tapiz compatible, this is the section where such guidelines are shared.

## Index

An Index of the main content is strongly encouraged.

# General suggestions of content formatting

It is strongly suggested to depart from "layout-first content-comes second" approaches for an embroidery. This strategy, while being aesthetically pleasing from the very first few pages it is often a trap for the free flow of the content. It is much better to focus on content first, using TXT format or more modern Markdown syntax and later on, display that content in a more typical RPG rulebook layout, including art.

That doesn't mean that the core content can't contain layout-related marks like "Special notice" to refer to a piece of text that would typically be shown in a highlighted box of some sort.

Finally, an embroidery shines when its content, at least mechanic-wise, is self-contained and only needs the Tapiz rulebook to support it. That means that any GM or player knowledgeable enough of the fantasy setting can start playing using these two documents.
